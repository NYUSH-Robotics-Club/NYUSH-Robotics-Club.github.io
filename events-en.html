        <h3>Embodied Spatial Intelligence: Bridging Perception, Reasoning, and Action</h3>
        <p>
          This talk introduces how machines learn to see, understand, and interact with the world in ways similar to humans.
          It explores embodied spatial intelligence, where agents build robust environmental representations to complete navigation and manipulation tasks.
          Topics included spatial mapping, unknown environment exploration, understanding human intention, and robot learning from human activity videos.
