        <h3>Embodied Spatial Intelligence: Bridging Perception, Reasoning, and Action</h3>
        <p>
          This talk introduces how machines learn to see, understand, and interact with the world in ways similar to humans.
          It delves into embodied spatial intelligence, where agents build robust representations of their surroundings to navigate and complete tasks.
          Topics include mapping, exploring unknown environments, human intention understanding, and video-based robot manipulation.
          The speaker also discusses the broader impact on autonomous driving, delivery, household automation, and space exploration.
